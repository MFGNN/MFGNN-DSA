# MFGNN-DSA
we propose a novel model for drug-side effect association prediction, MFGNN-DSA, which leverages the powerful capabilities of heterogeneous information networks and graph neural networks to comprehensively capture multiple features of drugs and side effects

# Requirements
* python == 3.10.9
* pytorch == 1.12.1
* numpy==1.24.0
* scikit-learn == 1.3.0


# Files:
1.data

disease.csv:	Disease node information
drug.csv:	Drug node information
drug_smiles.csv:	SMILES representations of drugs
label_end.txt:	Drug-side effect label list
mat_drug_disease.csv:	Drug-disease association matrix
mat_drug_se.csv:	Drugâ€“side effect association matrix
se.csv:	Side effect node information

2.feature

This folder contains the extracted attribute features and topological features of drugs and side effects, as well as their adjacency matrices:

Adjacency_matrix_drug.txt:	Adjacency matrix for drug nodes
Adjacency_matrix_se.txt:	Adjacency matrix for side effect nodes
drug_hin_disease.csv:	topological features of drugs via heterogeneous information network
drug_self.csv:	Self features of drugs
se_hin_disease.csv:topological features of drugs via heterogeneous information network
se_self.csv:	Self features of side effects

3.Code


# Train and test
python main.py --epochs Your number --batch_size Your number

epochs: Define the maximum number of epochs.

batch_size: Define the number of batch size for training and testing.

All files of Data and Code should be stored in the same folder to run the model.

Example:

```bash
python main.py
```
